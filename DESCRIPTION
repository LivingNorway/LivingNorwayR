Description: The package provides a workflow for creating a Darwin Core standard-compliant data archive ("a data package").
    This facilitates FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable; https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data
    sharing and uploading of Darwin Core archives (data packages) to repositories such as GBIF.  The Living Norway package
    also provides tools for the processing and manipulation of metadata associated with Darwin Core archives and for the
    import and export of metadata according to the EML (Ecological Metadata Language; https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)
    standard.
