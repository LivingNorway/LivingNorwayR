Description: The package provides a workflow for creating a Darwin Core Standard compliant data archive ( "a data package"). This facilitates FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable; https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data sharing and uploading Darwin Core Archieves (data packages) to repositories such as GBIF.
